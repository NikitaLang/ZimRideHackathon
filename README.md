# ZimRideMobile
A Rideshare app for Cornell Students\
Screenshots:

To connect drivers and passengers going places
# iOS
* Has two UICollectionViews. One is used to display notifications while the other displays rides available.
* Uses a UINavigationController to pop and push between views
* Integrates a MapKit API in order to display the current location and location of the destination

# Backend
* We implemented a database to store details about rides
* GET requests for obtaining specific rides and "buying the ride", and also requesting to see all rides
* DELETE request which deletes all rides departing before current date
* POST requests to search for specific rides and creating new rides by the dirver
* Deployed to Google Cloud

Pls be gentle I am soft
